# Qt_ToDo_QML

This project is a straightforward TODO application created with the Qt framework and QML, a powerful UI creation language. 
The UI was created using preconfigured QtQuick components. 

The list model that houses the to-do items is updated using a create list element method. The buttons to add a new item are linked to this function.
